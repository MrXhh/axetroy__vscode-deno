### typescript-deno-plugin

Adds Deno support for the Typescript Server.

The plugin was originally only [vscode-deno](https://github.com/axetroy/vscode-deno) service

And release with vscode extension.

So the versions follows vscode-deno and not the plugin itself

Means that you may upgrade from v2.0.0 to v3.0.0 without any changes.
